# SVG-Logo-Generator


## Description
  This code was built to produce a standard 3 letter logo with 3 basic shapes; circle, square, and triangle. Instead of taking 
  hours of your time to create from scratch, svg-logo-generator can create a basic logo in seconds using any combination of
  colors you can think of. By referencing this build, one can learn how to use module.exports, create constructor classes,
  and how to render a svg file.
